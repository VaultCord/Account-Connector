## Privacy

Only our client-side dashboard sees the details and it's NOT saved in database, do not worry.

We require 2FA so it's only temporary access to make a bot.
Most people use alt accounts for VaultCord anyways so their bot is safe if their account gets deleted..

You can always use the **Manual** option on our dashboard if that makes you more comfortable

Other websites & origins are **NOT** able to access data from the local webserver, there are security checks in place for that.
